Adaptive AI Job Application Bot
Overview

This project idea is for a self-learning automation tool that can find and fill job application forms directly on company websites.
The goal is to reduce repetitive manual form-filling by allowing the system to recognise and adapt to new input fields automatically.

Over time, the bot learns how to handle more form variations by remembering how similar fields were filled in the past.
It is designed as a personal assistant or research tool, not for large-scale scraping or automated mass applications.

Core Concept

Detects and analyses input fields on career or job application pages.

Reads each field’s attributes (label, placeholder, name, etc.).

Matches these attributes to known categories (e.g. “Name”, “Email”, “Upload CV”).

When encountering an unknown field, prompts for a decision (skip, fill, or custom response).

Stores the new rule for future use.

Learns over time, improving accuracy with each site it visits.

Key Features

Form field detection using browser automation

Intelligent field mapping through fuzzy matching and AI models

Persistent local database of learned field rules

Configurable filters and preferences

Optional dashboard for reviewing or editing learned data

Suggested Tech Stack
Programming Language

Python – Recommended for rapid prototyping, scraping, and AI integration

Alternative: Node.js (if you prefer JavaScript across the stack)

Web Automation

Playwright – Modern and reliable browser automation for dynamic websites

Alternative: Selenium (wider community support, slightly slower)

Data Parsing

BeautifulSoup4 – Easy HTML parsing for static pages

Alternative: lxml (faster but more complex)

Storage

SQLite – Simple file-based database for storing rules and form mappings

Alternative: PostgreSQL (for multi-user or scalable versions)

Fuzzy Matching and Semantic Analysis

FuzzyWuzzy or RapidFuzz – For simple string similarity

Optional: Sentence Transformers (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic matching using embeddings

Backend / API (if dashboard is added)

Flask or FastAPI – Lightweight Python web frameworks

Alternative: Laravel (PHP) or Express.js (Node.js)

Frontend (for dashboard)

React or Vue.js – For managing field mappings visually

Alternative: Basic HTML templates with Flask for simpler setups

Scheduling

Cron or Celery – To run periodic scans or updates

Optional AI Integration

OpenAI API – To generate cover letters or predict field meanings

Alternative: Local language models using transformers library (for offline use)

Learning Method

The bot uses a layered recognition system:

Rule-based: Direct text checks (e.g., “if ‘email’ in label”)

Fuzzy matching: Detects close matches like “E-mail” or “Contact Email”

Semantic comparison: Uses vector similarity to detect meaning

User input: Stores new instructions when unknown fields appear

Example Data Flow

Bot visits a company career page.

It finds all form elements (input, textarea, select).

For each field, it identifies its purpose using rules and text similarity.

If the field is recognised, it auto-fills it.

If the field is unknown, it logs the label and asks for guidance.

It stores the decision so next time, it knows what to do automatically.

Database Example
Field Label	Normalized Intent	Action	Value	Confidence
Full Name	name	fill	Liam Nugent	1.00
E-mail Address	email	fill	liamnugent@hizhub.com
	0.95
Upload Resume	cv_upload	fill	/path/to/cv.pdf	0.98
Preferred Pronouns	pronouns	skip	NULL	0.90
Development Roadmap

Create scraper for static job pages

Add Playwright to handle dynamic pages

Implement rule-based matching and fuzzy logic

Build local database for saving field knowledge

Add learning layer for new fields

Optionally add a web dashboard for review and control

Experiment with AI-assisted cover letter or resume matching
